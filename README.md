## Research 


*Trips by Weekday per Hour*

![This is an image](https://github.com/BrenyaSkaggs/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Trips%20by%20Weekday%20per%20Hour.png)

This shows the number of bike trips througout the week. Monday through Friday are typically the busiest
days with the start of the workday and the end of the work day being the most active. 



* Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)

![This is an image](https://github.com/BrenyaSkaggs/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Trips%20by%20Gender-%20weekday%20per%20hour.png)

Males have the highest number of bike trips througout the week compared to females. 



*User Trips by Gender by Weekday*

![This is an image](https://github.com/BrenyaSkaggs/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/user%20Trups%20by%20Gender%20by%20Weekday.png)

This shows the activity of bike trips throughtout the week for gender and both customer and subscribers. 
We can see that Male subscribers have the most bike trips throughout the week.




*Checkout Time by Gender and Checkout Time by User*

The graphs above list the number of bikes checked out by both gender and user within a 20min interval. 



*Customer vs Subscriber and Number of Riders*

![This is an image](https://github.com/BrenyaSkaggs/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Two%20Graphs.png)

This shows the breakdown of both customer vs subscribers and number of riders. 
*There are a total of 2,344,224 riders
    - 588,431 Females
    - 1,530,272 Males
    - 225521 Unknown

* There are 1,900,359 subscribers and 433,865 customers.    



## Summary 

After reviewing the August 2019 NYC CitiBike data we can see that there is a significant customer base 
in New York City, with males being the majority. We can see that trips are more common as a form of 
commuting to and from work throughout the week. I would recommend reviewing a years worth of data to 
in order to get a better idea on this would be successful in Des Moines, IA. We would be able to view
certain times throughout the year and figure out which season is best for biking. We could also have a 
better idea of how many people are customers vs subscribers. Do they cancel their "membership" during 
certain times? I would think a years overview would give a better overview on if this would work in 
another state.
